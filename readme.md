## Introduction

Bouncer provides a mechanism to handle roles and abilities in [Laravel's ACL](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/authorization). With an expressive and fluent syntax, it stays out of your way as much as possible: use it when you want, ignore it when you don't.

For a quick, glanceable list of Bouncer's features, check out [the cheat sheet](#cheat-sheet).

Bouncer works well with other abilities you have hard-coded in your own app. Your code always takes precedence: if your code allows an action, the bouncer will not interfere.


Once installed, you can simply tell the bouncer what you want to allow at the gate:

```php
// Give a user the ability to create posts
Bouncer::allow($user)->to('create', Post::class);

// Alternatively, do it through a role
Bouncer::allow('admin')->to('create', Post::class);
Bouncer::assign('admin')->to($user);

// You can also grant an ability only to a specific model
Bouncer::allow($user)->to('edit', $post);
```
